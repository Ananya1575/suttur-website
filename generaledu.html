                    <p>Until a few decades ago, quality pre-primary education was a privilege limited to the children of the elite in society. However, JSSMVP has been committed to providing equal access to quality education for all by establishing seven crèches and 19 nursery schools across Karnataka’s urban and rural areas. Four of the seven crèches are aided institutions, while only one of the 19 nursery schools is aided. The remaining 15 schools are operated entirely by JSSMVP. This effort by JSSMVP is a significant step towards bridging the educational gap between different sections of society and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to receive a strong foundation in education, regardless of their social or economic background.</p>

                    <p>JSSMVP operates JSS Sanskrit Schools to promote the study of ancient Indian wisdom, including Veda, Agama, and Astrology, which require proficiency in Sanskrit. The organization emphasizes Sanskrit's extensive use in literature, sacred hymns, philosophy, mythology, science, mathematics, history, poetry, drama, music, Ayurveda, and yoga, highlighting its relevance as the "language of the environment." Additionally, JSSMVP believes that learning Sanskrit sharpens memory and enhances cognitive skills. Over the past 60 years, JSSMVP has established 11 Sanskrit schools, starting with the Kyatanahalli Sri Siddlingaiah Samskruta Patashala in Mysuru, including five in rural areas to provide access to Sanskrit education for rural students. Currently, around 1,800 students, including 1,000 boys and 800 girls, are enrolled in these schools, where subjects like Veda, Agama Shastra, and Astrology are also taught in Mysuru and Suttur.

                        In 2013, His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamy inaugurated a Sanskrit college in Suttur to further this mission. The college offers specialized courses in Alankara, Shakthivishishtadwaitha Vedantha, Jyothishya, and Sanskrit language to talented rural students, fostering the preservation and dissemination of ancient knowledge. These initiatives by JSSMVP play a pivotal role in empowering students and ensuring the continued relevance of Sanskrit in modern education.</p>

                    <p>Providing Quality Education and Support for Children with Disabilities

                        Learning and performing specific activities can be challenging for children with disabilities. These children require specialized services to support them throughout their school years, including individual attention from instructors. At JSSMVP, we believe that with proper care, affection, guidance, and excellent education, these children can reach their full potential.
                        
                        To provide deserving children with quality education and support, Sahana Schools for Special Children were established in Bengaluru and Mysuru. Our schools offer education to children with special needs and raise awareness about their rights and responsibilities. We aim to uncover their latent talents and potential and help them integrate into mainstream society by boosting their confidence.
                        
                        Our specially trained and dedicated teachers have the necessary qualifications in special education. They embrace differences and strive to create an environment of humaneness. We categorize children based on their particular needs, abilities, and interests and provide specialized training in dance, drawing, sports, and music. We also encourage our students to participate in sports competitions and other activities, many of whom have won prizes.
                        
                        At Sahana Schools for Special Children, we are committed to providing an inclusive education that helps children with disabilities thrive.</p>

                    <p>JSS Maha Vidya Peetha Akshara Dasoha Yojane, in collaboration with the Government of Karnataka, initiated the provision of free mid-day meals to primary and high school children from rural areas in 2003-04.

The institution supplies the food from its central kitchen.

                        To address the poor health and learning abilities resulting from inadequate nutrition among economically backward and underprivileged children, JSSMVP decided to provide free mid-day meals to children studying in rural schools. This initiative aims to improve attendance and retention rates among children enrolled in rural schools, supporting educational objectives and promoting social equity.
                        
                        JSSMVP ensures that their staffs maintain high hygiene levels. They clean the vegetables and food grains before cooking, utilizing pure water for the cooking process. The central kitchen is well-maintained, and the utensils are cleaned daily before cooking and after serving the food.
                        
                        Currently, the project actively extends its coverage to schools located in Yelandur, a disadvantaged taluk in the Chamarajanagara district, and schools in the Mysuru district. JSSMVP takes the responsibility of bearing the expenses that go beyond the grants provided by the government.</p>
